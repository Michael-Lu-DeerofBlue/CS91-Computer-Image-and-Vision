Dithering
In this program, we accomplished a video filter program that the user can toggle between to switch to different filters. We accomplished to use the change the pixels array of p5.js. We were able to make the calculate from x,y coordinates to the exact pixel in the pixel array and vice versa. We also implemented different filter algorithms.

We, Michael and Abdul, worked together with assistance from p5.js and Floyd-Steinberg dithering wiki page.
