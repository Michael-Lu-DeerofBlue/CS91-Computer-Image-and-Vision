Abdul, Michael ajeter1@swarthmore.edu,ylu4@swartmore.edu 3/4/24 CS 91R Lab 5

Collaboration: We worked together on this assignment with help from the p5js website references
In this lab, we accomplished implementing a variety of sophisticated methods for doing the Hough Transform on images. In the filer, we calcualte the threshold by selecting the top 0.998 voted value as the threshold.

Warm-up
the first map call maps the value of angle from angle bin 0 to 100 to radian scale 0 to PI/2 so that we can do cos and sin calculation
the second map call maps the value of ditance from the scale of the diagonal the whole image to the scale of 0 to 100
