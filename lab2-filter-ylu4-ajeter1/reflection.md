Filters
In this program, we accomplished a video filter program that the user can toggle between to switch to different filters. We accomplished to implement the box blur, the gussian blur, the sobels and a funny filter. We learned how to use matrix to implement calculations and analysis for a chunk of pixels and transforms them to an expected result. We also explored the seperation of fliter matrix calculation and it improve the performance by "      "  and "       " seconds. For the funny filter, we did two moving stripes of rectangles, filtering the image dynamically.

We, Michael and Abdul, worked together with assistance from p5.js.
